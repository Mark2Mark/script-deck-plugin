## Brief

🤹‍♂️ Are you tired of memorizing endless shortcuts and digging through menus to run your essential scripts in GlyphsApp?

**Save time, clicks and mental energy. Discover a smarter way with ‘Script Deck’.**  

&nbsp;
## A Single shortcut

#### Access all your scripts with one shortcut

I recommend control+space  <kbd>⌃␣</kbd>  to open ‘Script Deck’, but feel free to choose a shortcut that suits you best.

&nbsp;
## Easy Like a Number Pad

**Run scripts effortlessly with button clicks or number keys.**

The Buttons are arranged like a keyboard’s number pad for intuitive operation and improved muscle memory.

Think of ‘Script Deck’ as a virtual pad controller. Providing unmatched flexibility and portability.

&nbsp;
## Button: Script

Right-click on a button, select **‘Set Script …’** and choose any Python script. The button will display the script’s menu title.

&nbsp;
## Button: Color

Optionally pick a color for quick visual identification.

&nbsp;
## Button: Icon

Also optionally, select an icon to quickly recognize your script’s purpose.

&nbsp;
## Manage Your Scripts

**‘Remove Script’:** Clear a script from a button.

**‘Reveal Script in Finder’:** Quickly access the script file in Finder for code adjustments.

_(These menu items only show if the button has a script assigned.)_

&nbsp;
## Navigate between Decks

Switch decks using arrow keys <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> or tab & shift+tab <kbd>⇥</kbd> / <kbd>⇧⇥</kbd> .
Alternatively, click on the dots which indicate the active deck.
‘Script Deck’ remembers the last used deck.

&nbsp;
## Customize Deck Names

Each deck can have a custom name. Use it for organization (e.g. ‘Layers’, ‘Components’, etc)

If not set, it shows a placeholder referencing the deck’s number.

&nbsp;
## Export & Import
**‘Export Deck’:** save your deck data to the Desktop as a .plist file.

**‘Import Deck’:** Load deck data from a .plist file.

This is handy for backup or you could switch between different script sets. (Today the design set and tomorrow engineering?)

&nbsp;
## Detailed Help

#### Setting the shortcut


_You need to do this only once in macOS:_

1.  > `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`
1. Select `Shortcuts` > `App Shortcuts`
1. Add `Glyphs 3`, set the Menu Title to `‘Script Deck’`
1. Choose your desired shortcut.

&nbsp;
## Download

#### Install it from the GlyphsApp Plugin Manager

In Glyphs 3 > Windows > Plugin Manager select ‘Plugins’ and search for ‘Script Deck’
